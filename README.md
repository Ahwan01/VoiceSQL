VoiceSQL is the latest system that allows users to access their databases using natural voice commands. 
It is an approach that simplifies what has been seen so far related to data querying. 
It combines the capabilities of voice recognition, natural language processing, andSQL query generation to just discontinue technical knowledge about SQL or databasemanagement from the users' side.
All the user needs to do is to just utter what he wants to askand the system will then realize the intention of his statement, convert it into some accurateSQL query, and bring out the results from the database.
Such a solution is quite helpful to those non-technical users in general, providing themwith a straightforward and intuitive way to access and manipulate data.
Its applications arebusiness intelligence, health care, education, and financial services, where fast access to thedata is key.
Integration does not become a problem since VoiceSQL can easily fit within anexisting database system.
Hence, implementation or adoption does not require considerablechanges in infrastructure.
From VoiceSQL, real-time processing and accuracy and ease of use,the real-time revolution will change the way people access their data, with an exact means tofree many more people to improve many more decision-making processes.
